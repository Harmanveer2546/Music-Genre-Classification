## Music Genre Classification -
Classifying the genre of a music using deep neural networks

### Introduction-
Music Genre classification is one of the branches of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). 
A robust recommendation system begins with the categorization of music genres. Sound processing is a huge reaseach area 
through which we can find solutions to various medical or mental issues through music theraphy solutions.<br>
There are various music applications such as Spotify, Google Play, Apple Music, etc., but for implementation, one of the most 
important steps is to classify the genre of a music which requires audio processing, it is one of the most complex tasks that 
involves time signal processing, time series, spectrograms, spectral coefficients, and audio feature extraction to feed a neural network.

### Dataset description-
The dataset used is GTZAN (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)
The GTZAN dataset contains 1000 audio files. Contains a total of 10 genres, each genre contains 100 audio files.<br>

1.Blues<br>
2.Classical<br>
3.Country<br>
4.Disco<br>
5.Hip-hop<br>
6.Jazz<br>
7.Metal<br>
8.Pop<br>
9.Reggae<br>
10.Rock<br>

#### Genres original-
A compilation of ten genres, each with 100 audio recordings, each lasting 30 seconds (the famous GTZAN dataset, the MNIST of sounds)

#### Images original
Each audio file has a visual representation. Neural networks are one technique to classify data because 
they usually take in some form of picture representation.

#### CSV files
The audio files' features are contained within. Each song lasts for 30 seconds long has a mean and variance 
computed across several features taken from an audio file in one file. The songs are separated into 3 second 
audio files in the other file, which has the same format.
